----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an efficient, C++ implementation of several Bayesian
optimization algorithms. See References for some of the papers.

It combines the use of a stochastic process as a surrogate function
with some "active learning" criterion to find the optimum of an
"arbitrary" function using very few iterations. It can also be used
for sequential experimental design and stochastic bandits by selecting
the adequate criterion.

Using old C++ standards (C++98), it can be used with many compilers in
Windows, Linux, Mac OS. There are APIs for C/C++, Python and
Matlab/Octave.

Important: This code is free to use. However, if you are using, or
plan to use, the library, specially if it is for research or academic
purposes, please send me an email (rmcantin@unizar.es) with your name,
institution and a brief description of your interest for this code
(one or two lines).
