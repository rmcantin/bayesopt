{"name":"Bayesopt","tagline":"BayesOpt: A toolbox for bayesian optimization, experimental design and stochastic bandits.","body":"BayesOpt: A Bayesian optimization library\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nBayesOpt is an efficient implementation of the Bayesian optimization\r\nmethodology for nonlinear-optimization, experimental design,\r\nstochastic bandits and hyperparameter tunning. In the literature it is\r\nalso called Sequential Kriging Optimization (SKO), Sequential\r\nModel-Based Optimization (SMBO) or Efficient Global Optimization\r\n(EGO).\r\n\r\nThe online HTML version of these docs:\r\n<http://rmcantin.bitbucket.org/html/>\r\n\r\nBayesian optimization uses a distribution over functions to build a\r\nmodel of the unknown function for we are looking the extrema, and then\r\napply some active learning strategy to select the query points that\r\nprovides most potential interest or improvement. Thus, it is a\r\nsampling efficient method for nonlinear optimization, design of\r\nexperiments or bandits-like problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting and installing BayesOpt\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe library can be download from any of this sources:\r\n\r\n- Download: <https://bitbucket.org/rmcantin/bayesopt>\r\n- Mirror: <https://github.com/rmcantin/bayesopt>\r\n- Mirror: <http://mloss.org/software/view/453/>\r\n\r\nYou can also get the *cutting-edge* version from the repositories:\r\n\r\n    >> hg clone https://bitbucket.org/rmcantin/bayesopt\r\n\r\nor the git mirror:\r\n\r\n    >> git clone https://github.com/rmcantin/bayesopt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe install guide and documentation for Windows, Linux and MacOS:\r\n- [Online install guide](http://rmcantin.bitbucket.org/html/install.html) \r\n  or [Local install guide](@ref install)\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting involved\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe best place to ask questions and discuss about BayesOpt is the\r\n[bayesopt-discussion mailing\r\nlist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bayesopt-discussion). Alternatively,\r\nyou may directly contact Ruben Martinez-Cantin <rmcantin@unizar.es>.\r\n\r\nPlease file bug reports or suggestions at:\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/rmcantin/bayesopt/issues\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing BayesOpt for academic or commercial purposes\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBayesOpt is licensed under the GPL and it is free to use. However,\r\nplease consider these recomentations when using BayesOpt:\r\n\r\n- If you use BayesOpt in a work that leads to a **scientific\r\npublication**, we would appreciate it if you would kindly cite BayesOpt\r\nin your manuscript. Cite BayesOpt as:\r\n\r\n> Ruben Martinez-Cantin, **BayesOpt: A Bayesian Optimization\r\n> Library for Nonlinear Optimization, Experimental Design and\r\n> Bandits**.
